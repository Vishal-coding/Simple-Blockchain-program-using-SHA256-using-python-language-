# Simple-Blockchain-program-using-SHA256-using-python-language-
This program uses hashlib module to hash the values,encode()is used to encode the string into binary later hexdigest()is used to convert into a hexadecimal address.
the output of the SHA256 is a 64 hexadecimal address that is 256/4=64(hexadecimal).Even a single change in Upper or lower case letters in the input can change totally the hashed output.
